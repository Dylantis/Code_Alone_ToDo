# Code_Alone_ToDo
This is the ToDo list in the Web Developer Bootcamp 2020 by Colt Steele (Udemy). This copy is my attempt to do it solo. There is a prompt that will ask "What Would You Like To Do?" The HTML file gives the options on the page, the rest runs in the console by JS. You can add a 'new' todo that will show in the console. you can 'list' all the to do's added and is listed in index and name in console log. There is a 'delete' function that you put in the index number and i will delete the corresponding to do. Then when you are all done there is a 'quit option'. this exercise put a lot of emphasis on loops and indexing. i would like to have put more catch alls like toLowerCase(), trim(), and an option that would give a response if an action was not recognized. im happy with my outcome but theres always room for improvement!
